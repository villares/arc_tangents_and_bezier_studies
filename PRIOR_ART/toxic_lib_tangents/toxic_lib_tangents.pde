/**
 * <p>This simple example shows how to compute tangent points on a circle using
 * the new Circle and Line2D classes. Furthermore, the demo shows how these points
 * are constructed geometrically and how to use the ToxiclibsSupport class of
 * the toxi.processing package to handle the drawing of these geometrical shapes.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Usage:</strong><ul>
 * <li>move mouse to move/recalculate tangents</li>
 * <li>click+drag mouse to adjust circle radius</li>
 * </ul></p>
